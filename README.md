# My First Encounter with TypeScript 🚀

This repository is a personal learning space for documenting my first encounter with **TypeScript**.

The goal of this repo is simple:
to understand how TypeScript works and how its type system changes the way I think about writing code.

It’s a playground, a notebook, and sometimes a mess, but an intentional one.

## Repository structure

- Each folder represents a learning stage or topic
- Some subfolders are independent mini-projects
- Compiled JavaScript may be included for learning and comparison purposes

Details about each folder live inside their respective directories.

> Mistakes are part of the process and they stay visible on purpose.
