# My First Encounter with TypeScript 🚀

This repository is a personal learning space to documenting with **TypeScript**.

So, the goal is to understand how TypeScript works and how its type system changes the way I think about writing code.

It’s a playground, a notebook, and sometimes a mess, but an intentional one.

## Repository structure

- Each folder represents a learning stage or material
- Some subfolders are independent mini-projects
- Compiled JavaScript may be included for learning and comparison purposes (in "/dist" folder)

Details about each folder live inside their respective directories.

> Mistakes are part of the process and they stay visible on purpose.

__All command-line explanations are in Indonesian [🇮🇩].__
