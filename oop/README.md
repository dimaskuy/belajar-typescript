## Object-Oriented Programming in TypeScript

Open /tests and /src to view the materials or supporting materials. This course focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in TypeScript, covering the following topics:

```
1. Class
2. Constructor
3. Properties
4. Method
5. Getter and Setter
6. Inheritance
7. Interface Inheritance
8. Super Constructor
9. Method Overriding
10. Super Method
11. Visibility (public, protected, private)
12. Parameter Properties
13. Operator instanceof
14. Polymorphism
15. Type Casting
16. Abstract Class
17. Static Properties and Methods
18. Class Relationship
19. Error Handling
20. Namespace
21. Next Materials

```

The main advantage of TypeScript in OOP is its strongly typed system, which helps prevent common runtime errors and improves code readability and maintainability. Features such as interfaces, abstract classes, visibility modifiers, and type casting are fully supported.

_If you want to see the main differences between TypeScript and JavaScript syntax, you can inspect the compiled files in the /dist folder, but it’s quite messy._
