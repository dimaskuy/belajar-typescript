## BASIC MATERIAL

Open  "/tests" and "/src" to view the materials or supporting-materials. This course's subject contains:

```
1. "Hello World"
2. Primitive Data Types
3. Array
4. Data types: Any
5. Type Union
6. Type Alias
7. Object
8. Type Enum
9. Data types: Undefined (and Null)
10. Type Interface
11. Functions
12. Function Overloading
13. Function as Parameter (Callback)
14. Conditional (If, Else, Else-if, Ternary, Switch-Case)
15. Looping (For, While, Do-while)
```

_Note_: All other JavaScript features are similar in TypeScript, such as:
Mathematical operators, comparison, logic, template strings, chaining, with statements, default parameters, generator functions, getters/setters, destructuring, modules, libraries, and more.

The main difference is that TypeScript is strongly typed: we must define and expect specific data types for variables and parameters. However, if you want behavior similar to JavaScript where variables/parameters are flexible, you can use the "any" type, but with discipline.

_If you want to see the main differences between TypeScript and JavaScript syntax, you can inspect the compiled files in the /dist folder, but it’s quite messy._
